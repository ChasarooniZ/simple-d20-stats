# simple-d20-stats
A foundryvtt module that shows d20 statitiscs in a bar chart allowing to choose a date range.

I developed this module to track roll data for my sessions and compare it over time. There is always that player blaming the dice, now you have evidence!

This module saves the d20 roll results for each user. It adds a button on the left UI panel that opens a window, creating a bar chart. This chart allows you to view the data of the selected user and the date range for those rolls. It also includes a simple table showing who has rolled more Nat1s and Nat20s.

On mouse hover you can see the percentage of that rolls:

<b>Note:</b> Rolls from attacks are only supported in <b>pf2e</b> and <b>dnd5e</b>. If I add more features, they would likely be only for <b>pf2e</b> as it is the system I am playing.

Settings allow you to erase all the saved data, enable the players to see the GM statistics and disable saving self, private and blind rolls.

I keep my host active during the week, and my players enjoy editing their characters or testing new ones. To prevent these test rolls from skewing the real session statistics, I added a pause data feature. There is a warning message when it is disabled, and someone logs in. If the DM logs in, it creates a chat message as a reminder.
