# simple-d20-stats
A foundryvtt module that shows d20 statitiscs in a bar chart allowing to choose a date range.

I created this module to allow the tracking of rolled data for my sessions and compare over time. There is always that player blaming the dices, now you have evidence. 

This module saves the d20 roll results per user, adds a button on the left UI panel to open a window creating a bar chart allowing to see the data of the desired user and the date range for those rolls along a simple table showing who has rolled more Nat1 and Nat20.

On mouse hover you can see the percentage of that rolls:

<b>Note:</b> Rolls from attack is only supported in <b>pf2e</b> and <b>dnd5e</b>. If I add more features, they would probably be only for <b>pf2e</b> as it is the system I am playing.

Settings allow you to erase all the saved data, enable the players to see the GM statistics and disable saving self, private and blind rolls.

I leave my host active during the week and my players like to edit their characters or test new ones. I added a pause data to avoid those test rolls to fake the real sessions statistics, there is a warning message when it is disabled and someone logs in, if the dm logs in, it creates a chat message with the reminder.
