# simple-d20-stats
A foundryvtt module that shows d20 statitiscs in a bar chart allowing to choose a date range.

This module saves the d20 roll results per user, adds a button on the left UI panel to open a window creating a bar chart allowing to see the data of the desired user and the date range for those rolls along a simple table showing who has rolled more Nat1 and Nat20.

Settings allow you to erase all the saved data, enable the players to see the GM statistics and disable saving self, private and blind rolls.

I left my host active during the week and my players like to edit their characters or test new ones. I added a pause data to avoid this rolls to fake the real sesions statistics, there is a warning message when someone logs and it is disabled and when the dm logs in it creates a chat message with the reminder.
